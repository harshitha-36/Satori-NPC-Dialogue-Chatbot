# AI-Driven NPC Dialogue Chatbot using Dialogflow CX and Vertex AI


<!-- Briefly describe the project in one sentence. --> 

---

## About


This project is an AI-powered NPC interaction system that enables natural, dynamic, and context-aware voice conversations in games. It addresses the limitations of traditional NPCs that rely on static dialogue trees by leveraging Dialogflow CX and Google Vertex AI. The main objective is to enhance immersion, engagement, and multilingual accessibility in gaming environments. It supports real-time, unscripted conversations and offers cross-platform integration using Unity, Firebase, and cloud APIs.
